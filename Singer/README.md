# Sing

Configure songs with commands, calculates song duration based on active job abilities and gear equipped 
at the endcast, supports two dummy songs, checks active song buffs casted by player (as recorded by the addon) and detects song+ 
instruments, (if found in inventory/wardrobe.) and applies it to your song limit.

*[buff] name of buff, currently supports all bard buffs 
    e.g march, minuet, madrigal, scherzo, prelude, ballad, mazurka are all valid buff names
    Note: Etudes and Carols are a bit different. If you want STR Etude you would do setude, DEX deteude, VIT vetude, etc etc
          For Carols if you wanted Fire Carol you would do fcarol, Ice icarol, etc etc. With two exceptions Lightning Carol is tcarol as in Thunder Resistance because there is also Light Carol which is lcarol and Water Carol is acarol as in Aqua because of Wind Carol being wcarol.
