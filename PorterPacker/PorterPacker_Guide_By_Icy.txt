Setting up jobs to utilize PorterPacker to keep your storage/inventory as clean as possible.

	Addons you'll need:
		PorterPacker - https://github.com/Ivaar/Windower-addons
		Gearswap - Windower Launcher's Addons tab
		Porter - Windower Launcher's Addons tab
		Itemizer - Windower Launcher's Addons tab

Storing a jobs gear via slips:
	1. Run  [//get storage slip* all]  or manually pull out the slips that you want to utilize.
		- Personally, I use the get command and when done I use the put command. IE: [//put storage slip* sack all]
		
	2. Get on the job you want store and stand next to the porter moogle.
		- Personally, I use the Mog Gardens porter moogle
		
	3. pull out all the jobs AF/Relic/Empy gear from your wardrobes.
	   ~ Tip: Load Porter and Run  [//porter find]   to identify the storable items in your Wardrobes.
	 3A. Run  [//gs org]  to get all the gear that's used by the job
	 3B. Manually store items that you wouldn't want porterpacker to pull out when regearing up, either into slips or somewhere that's not your inventory
		
	4. Load PorterPacker and run [//po export]
		~ This will create a file in porterpacker's data folder. ie: 'export_{yourname}_{job}.lua'
		  ^ The generated file is how it knows what item to retrieve when you want to pull them out of the slips later on.
			
	5. Rename the 'export_{yourname}_{job}.lua' to just '{yourname}_{job}.lua'

	6. Run  [//po pack]  to store the job's storable gear into the slips.
		Note: This command doesn't use the generated file, it will store ALL storable items within your inventory.
		
	7. Run the put command to place your slips back into your bags. [//put storage slip* sack all]
DONE!


Now when you want to retrieve the stored gear:
	1. Get on the job you want to regear. 
	2. Run  [//get storage slip* all]
	3. Run  [//gs org]
	4. Run  [//po unpack]
		~ Tip: Run  [//gs validate]  to make sure you are not missing any gear.
	5. Run  [//put storage slips* sack all]  ...or where ever you want to store them.
DONE!


You can now create the following windower scripts to streamline the process.


Example Windower script for the retrieval process. 
	1. Create a new text file in the scripts folder. 
		ie: windower/scripts/GetGear.txt
		
	2. Add the following commands to the GetGear.txt file.

//--------------------------START OF SCRIPT-------------------------------
input /echo > Loading PorterPacker...;
lua l PorterPacker
wait 1;

input /echo > Pulling out the slips from storage...;
get storage slip* all;
wait 3;

input /echo > Pulling out the jobs gear from storage...;
gs org;
wait 5;

input /echo > Pulling out the jobs gear from the slips... (15 sec);
po unpack;
wait 15;

input /echo > Returning slips to storage...;
put storage slip* sack all;
wait 3;

input /echo > Unloading PorterPacker...;
lua unload PorterPacker;
wait 1;

input /echo ~~ DONE! ~~;
//--------------------------END OF SCRIPT---------------------------------
	
	3. Change to the job you are gearing up and run  [//exec getgear]  to get your gear.



Example Windower script for the storing any storable gear.
	1. Create a new text file in the scripts folder. 
		ie: windower/scripts/StoreGear.txt

	2. Add the following commands to the StoreGear.txt file.

//--------------------------START OF SCRIPT-------------------------------
input /echo > Loading PorterPacker...;
lua l PorterPacker
wait 1;

input /echo > Getting slips...;
get storage slip* all;
wait 5;

input /echo > Storing gear with porter moogle...;
po store
wait 15;

input /echo Storing slips...;
put storage > slip* sack all;
wait 5;

input /echo > Unloading PorterPacker...;
lua unload PorterPacker;
wait 1;

input /echo ~~ DONE! ~~;
//--------------------------END OF SCRIPT---------------------------------

	3. Run  [//exec storegear]  to store your jobs gear.
