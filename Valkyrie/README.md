# Valkyrie
A windower addon to streamline Einherjar entry.

Action                | Addon Command
--------------------- | -----------------------------
Load                  | //lua l valkyrie
Unload                | //lua u valkyrie
Register Chamber      | //valk register \<chamber\>
Enter                 | //valk enter
Drop Lamp             | //valk drop


Currently does not work with the two Odin chambers as I have not collected the necessary data.  
\<chamber\> should be replaced with 'en' values from [data/chambers.lua](https://github.com/Tny5989/Valkyrie/blob/master/data/chambers.lua).	  You can use the auto-translated names.  

As with all my addons, this is still a work in progress and should be used at your own risk.
